# Text-Processing

Text-Processing is a personal project where i use machine learning to predict the most likely outcome using C#.

With Text-Processing, you can train it to predict a int value based on the inputed text. The machine learning program uses Bayes Theorum and a Bayesian Neural Netowkr Structure.

# Test case scenario : Positive and negative opinons
For tests i use the scenario of having to predict if a scentence or a peice of text has positive or negative opinon behind it.

Training Data:
