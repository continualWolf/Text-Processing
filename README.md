# Text-Processing

Text-Processing is a personal project where i use machine learning to predict the most likely outcome using C#.

With Text-Processing, you can train it to predict a int value based on the inputed text, for example assume 1 = posotive opinion if you inputed "I had a wonderful" you should expect an output of 1. The machine learning program uses Bayes Theorum and a simple Bayesian Neural Network.

# Test case scenario : Positive and negative opinons
For tests i use the scenario of having to predict if a scentence or a peice of text has positive or negative opinon behind it.

Training Data:
  - IMDB reviews
  - Amazon reviews
  - Yelp reviews

The training data is formated as follows:
                                                  
                                                  The book was awful, i have never read anything worse.  1
